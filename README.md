# Spelling BusyBees

My app is called Spelling BusyBees. It’s a dictionary app for kids to look up their spelling words of the week and to keep track of their previous defined words in a list format. I chose this dictionary API because it provides definitions, pronunciations and example sentence for Intermediate level. In the future, I’d like to add a feature so that users can also find the synonym of the word and store previous words searches on a spelling list to review again when needed.

## User Stories:

(1) Who are the users?

*Children around grades 6-8.*

*To define their spelling words for homework and help them study.*

(3) What are they going to do?

*Use this app as a main go-to source to define their spelling words in terminologies they understand wih sentence examples. It will also be an app that can store their previous searched words in a list form to refer back to.*

## Wireframes:
I used a free program Wireframe.cc to create my wireframes. This is to get an idea of how I want my layout to be for the main page with search bar and the definition results page.

**Main page with search bar:** https://wireframe.cc/DURNAo

## Modifications/Hurdles/Unsolved Problems

**Modifications:**

**Hurdles:**

I was having issues retrieving the data from arrays nested few layers within. I've tried multiple ways but no data would return in display. Eventually I asked for an extra few sets of eyes to help me, GA peers (Mindy, Dan, Sage and Peter) and GA Instructor (Hou) that I finally got the data to pass through properly. Who knew that you would need to set a condition to verify there is data to pass through and THEN display. Everyday you learn something new!
